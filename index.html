				<h1>The Current State of the Floral Industry</h1>
				<div id="byline">by Euna Park and Jackie Wattles</div></br></br>

				<!-- cali drought story -->


				<p>While the numbers say that the floral industry is a wilting one, the rise of 
					interest in floral design and flower academies seem to prove otherwise. However, 
					as the flower industry is one dependent on the environment, states like California 
					are taking hits to the flower industry. </p> </br>

					<p>According to California Cut Flower Commission, California supplies around 20 to 25 
					percent of cut flowers sold in the United States. Cypress Flower Farm, located in 
					Moss Beach, California, are reducing their crop sizes as natural water resource 
					supplies are drying up in addition to rising water prices.</p>

				<!-- current industry: flower schools, DIY popularizing flower arranging etc -->

				<p>With many DIY-championed spirits and sites like Pinterest and Etsy, 
					everyday men and women have grown increasingly interested in 
					flower-arranging. Special workshop classes, like those at the Little 
					Flower School in Brooklyn, offer students of all skills to learn how 
					to arrange flowers like wildflowers, peonies, dahlias into loose, 
					natural, garden-style floral designs. The owners, Nicolette Owen and 
					Sarah Ryhanen, both run their own floral design studios and Ryhanen 
					has her own flower farm called Worlds End in Albany. </p></br>

				<p>Ryhanen wrote on the Worlds End that she hopes her farm will eventually
				 become a center for botanic arts and a farm that can supply her fellow 
				 flower business friends with “unusually beautiful flowers.”</p></br>

				<p>The Flower School Brooklyn holds seasonally oriented classes that focus
				 on particular flowers or design concepts. The students range from novices 
				 to professionals interested in starting their own businesses. </p>

			<!-- information on flower schools and florist occupation -->
			<p>Though people regularly buy flowers, many do not go more in-depth to arrange 
				flowers. However, there has been a recent rise in young men and women 
				interested in flower-arranging, according to the New York Times. Over the 
				past several years, flower schools and academies have developed. Flower 
				designers have also said that private lessons are popular as well.</p>

			<!-- where the industry will go-->

			<p>Bear Stearns wasn’t the only company that went up in flames during the 2008 
				financial crisis; everyone felt the impact—including the flower industry. 
				While the economy slowly returned to a better state, florists and flower 
				farms still needed to work out heavy damage. With the birth of e-commerce 
				flower sites like 1-800-Flowers, boutique flower shops have seen a fall in 
				business. The flower industry as a whole has not made a comeback since 2008 
				and experts don’t believe that it will improve any time soon. </p></br>

			<p>Despite the hardships the flower industry faces in terms of economics, those 
				actually in the business, especially in small businesses, are making their 
				efforts worthwhile. As students are enrolling into flower schools and design 
				workshops, florists are finding ways to integrate modern trends popularized 
				through social media with their skillset. </p>
